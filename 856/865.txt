Substitution cyphers are the simplest of cyphers where the letters of one alphabet are substituted for the letters of another alphabet. In one form or another, they've been in use for over 2000 years.

Input 

The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.


a line containing the plaintext alphabet
a line containing the substitution alphabet
several lines of text
Output 

For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.


a line containing the substitution alphabet
a line containing the plaintext alphabet
the converted lines of text
Please note: All lines will be at most 64 characters, plus a trailing end-of-line character. Pass through all characters not found in the plaintext alphabet.

Shar's Birthday:
The birthday is October 6th, but the party will be Saturday,
October 5.  It's my 24th birthday and the first one in some
years for which I've been employed.  Plus, I have new clothes.
So I have cause to celebrate.  More importantly, though,
we've cleaned the house!  The address is 506-D Albert Street.
Extra enticement for CS geeks:  there are several systems in
the house, and the party is conveniently scheduled for 3 hours
after the second CSC programming contest ends (not to mention,
within easy walking distance)!
